Bullet Hell:

similar experience to terraria supreme calamitas fight. 

Small Manageable Tasks for today:
- get 2 or more enemies spawned on edge in random positions each time


Stuff to implement (eventually): 

regular bullets:
- appear offscreen
- strictly horizontal / vertical movement
	- horizontal appear on left or right edges
	- vertical appear on top or bottom edges
- erased when hitting opposite edge of spawn edge

homing bullets:
- appear offscreen, all 4 edges
- erased when hitting edge of screen

homing explosives
- think of supreme calamitas fight
- those things that explode and send shrapnel in all directions
- might have to make screen bigger - a lot of bullets

score:
-time survived.
-save high scores in a file, write to txt file maybe?
